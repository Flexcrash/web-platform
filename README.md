# Flexcrash Platform
This repository contains the code of the Flexcrash platform for studying live interactions between human drivers and automated vehicles (AV).
The **current version of the platform is 1.0** (See deliverable D1.2)


## About Flexcrash
The Flexcrash project is focused on the development of a flexible and hybrid manufacturing technology to produce tailored adaptive crash-tolerant structures made of green aluminum alloys.   

The project selects vehicle parts and applies surface patterns onto performed parts with the objective to reduce weight, increase safety and optimize crash performance of current and future vehicles.  

Flexcrash solutions are to provide a general improvement of car safety with a reduction of risks and fatalities in crashes.
